commentary: Presents climate change and the current moment through some interesting philosophical lenses, but comes off somewhat preachy & naive, and doesn’t discuss any radically novel ideas.

### Intro
- Climate change → more frequent & intense natural disasters, impacting already disadvantaged communities
- Shifts in temperature, seasons, weather trends too rapid for most species to adapt to; too fast for our brains to grasp change of reference for extreme weather
- ⇒ **Solastalgia** — ****a deep longing for the natural world that we know is never coming back
- Even in states like Kansas, etc., changes to rainfall, more droughts → serious effects on agriculture
    - Outside Alaska, Minnesota = fastest warming state in the US!
- “We must begin a transition to a new kind of environmentalism that reflects the way the actual environment works. Not a demonstration of individualism or moral superiority, but an actionable, scalable model for a new way of life rooted in collective support and universal justice.”
- We feel uneasy in *liminal spaces* (dark stairwells, rest stops, the time after a breakup...), and right now the whole world is one → it’s time for a radical change
    - Concept from philosopher Samantha Earle
    - During normal times, don’t have critical awareness or ability to *radically imagine*, but liminal spaces → so much uncertainty about the foundational principles by which we live that “anything is possible”
    - “There is creative power in discomfort.”
- Climate change is now too *intersectional* to ignore...
    - Conversation on solutions has focused too much on *adaptation* vs *transformation*
    - Kate Marvel → this moment demands courage, not hope— cannot try to feel more comfortable, but rather confront the chaotic and uncertain reality
- Central to problem = **ownership** → our task must be to establish new power structures → less systemic problems
    - Decentralisation → focus on deeper relationships between people and with nature, trust, etc.
    - Idealized model of how we treat our friends and family, but on a global scale
    - Climate change = symptom of the problem, not the cause
    - Ex. Project Drawdown → most effective solutions include educating girls
- Will present what radical change may look like in each decade through the 2040s

### 2020-2030: Catastrophic Success
- How to handle climate refugees?
    - Michael Gerrard → could be provided permanent residency, distributed in countries proportionately by historic national emissions
- Increased frequency of climate and weather disasters: droughts, storms, fires
- *Radical changes:* granting legal protection and rights to the Earth, nature; criminalising actions with climate change harm

### 2030-2040: Radical Stewardship
- Establishing not just renewable *energy*, but a renewable *economy,* governed by a new kind of politics
    - Move past capitalism → circular economy acknowledging planetary boundaries
    - More literacy in not just carbon footprint, but all metrics and impacts of society
- Global sharing of ideas with local production → stewardship economy
    - Urbanisation, more focus on services/experiences than goods
    - Change in materials from concrete, electrification > coal for heating
    - Eventual elimination of air travel → global hyperloop (slower, but dealt with it— 2 days from NY to London)
    - Regenerative agriculture
- “By 2040, the world cut its emissions by two-thirds of current levels, but even with that reduction, temperatures continued to rise. Even a partial collapse of the glaciers in Antarctica and Greenland created a sea-level emergency.”

### 2040-2050: New Technologies and New Spiritualities
- What’s the verdict on geoengineering?
    - What happens if, despite dropping emissions, the climate tipping points are already triggered?
    - Carbon sequestration by **bioenergy carbon capture and storage (BECCS)**: growing plants, burning them for fuel, and capturing emissions? → could threaten food supply if implemented at large scales
    - Instead, convert CO2 back to oil and coal → pump back to oil fields, mines
- Humanitarian geoengineering?
    - Spraying aerosols becomes a huge lever of political power and manipulation, risk of authoritarianism

### Epilogue
- The most important thing we can do about climate change is talk about it
- “We need to relearn our interdependence.”
