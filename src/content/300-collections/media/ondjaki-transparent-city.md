- "«the difference between a guy who’s just smart and a guy who’s smart and clued-in» Paulo Paused thought, «is that the former has useless obsessions and talks about stuff he doesn’t understand and the latter chooses his obsessions and rarely speaks of what he’s already grasped..." (95)
- "in the end, what is a place full of humans who worry so little about others? what is a place full of cars containing solitary people trying to run down time and mistreat others in order to get home to greet their own solitariness? what is a place full of rumours and celebrations and burials with so much food, if no one can knock on a stranger’s door any more to ask for a glass of water or find a reason to take a break beneath the cool shade of a fig tree «this city is a desert» he thought as he walked" (102)

- "«the war» he said to himself, «is an eternally bleeding memory, and at some point you open your mouth or make a motion, and what comes out is the blood-red trail of things you didn’t know you knew» all Angolans, therefore, had some sort of paranoia about weapons or armaments, they all had a tale to tell or an episode to invent" (116)
- “we don’t always get what we want, that’s what life will teach you one day... at times we don’t get even the simplest things” (149)

- “"all the worlds get mixed up, pardon my poetic speech, but we’re all water from the same river” “minus those beyond the third bank, as the master Guimarães would say” “minus those beyond each individual’s bank,”" (223)
- “each Luandan is a creator of his own tale, just be careful you don’t pick up the habit” (224)
