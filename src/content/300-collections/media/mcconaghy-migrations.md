- The feeling halfway between desperation and excitement
- The Arctic tern → longest migration of any animal, from Arctic to Antarctic and back every year
    - Over course of their lives (30 years+), fly the distance fo the moon and back three times!!
- “You’re late.” “My gift to you, since you take such pleasure in pointing it out.”
- It takes water in the ocean 10,000 (or 1000?) years to complete a cycle around the world
- A life can be measured by how much it gives and leaves behind in the world— or by how much it takes.
- There is meaning to our lives, maybe— and it lives in nurturing.
