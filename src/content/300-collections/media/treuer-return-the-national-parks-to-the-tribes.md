- “The American West began with war but concluded with parks.”
- “A lack of access to land—and the lack of power that such access would confer—undergirds the social ills that affect many Native peoples.”
- “Parks, as they’ve existed for 149 years, have done a decent job of preserving the past. But it’s not clear that today’s model of care and custodianship best meets the needs of the land, Native people, or the general public. Nor is it clear that the current system will adequately ensure the parks’ future. That’s something Indians are good at: pushing ahead while bringing the past along with us. We may be able to chart a better way forward.”
