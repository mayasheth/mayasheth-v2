- “...the myth of meritocracy teaches you that if you do say no — in or out of freelance life — you are closing off roads to your potential excellence...Of course, much of this ethos can be traced back to Calvinist understandings of a desire to work all the time as evidence of one’s status as Elect, aka pre-destined for eternal salvation. That’s the moral component. It just happens to intersect with the capitalist imperative to recognize and reward continual, preferably exponential, growth... **The manager’s crisis refrain of “feel free to take some time, if you need it” is fundamentally a sorting question: are you someone who needs it or are you someone who can ignore that you do?“”**
- “If you work for yourself in whatever capacity, you get the same question, only **it’s coming from inside your brain.** Are you a person who needs it, or are you a hustler who prides themselves on getting things done? Are you a person who needs it, or do you recognize times as crisis as a moment to distinguish yourself? Are you a person who needs rest and reprieve, or are have you wholly internalized the worst manager in the world and allowed them to shade every hour of your day?”
- “In hindsight, what excited me about the second vaccine shot was **the permission structure that accompanied it.** There wasn’t a productive choice I could make within that structure.”
