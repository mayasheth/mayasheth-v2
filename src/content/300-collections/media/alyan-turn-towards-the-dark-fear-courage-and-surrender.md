- “It’s an emotion that rarely exists in the present moment. Often it needs the past or future to feed on, a feedback loop to keep it alive.”
- “I’ve found it useful to think of it as a well-meaning hijacker, one that lives and dies by a single code: *keep her safe at all costs*. It’s hard not to feel some gratitude toward fear when it’s conceptualized this way.”
