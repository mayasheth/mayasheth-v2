commentary: What did I learn? I had never thought about cobalt (its uses, impact of mining) or the political history of the Congo beyond King Leopold. Definitely added a layer of complexity to my view of geopolitical relations (China controls most of the mines?) and unintended consequences of electrification.

- “Artisanal” (which sounds fancy but just means small-scale) mining of cobalt is intrinsically tied to electrification and the absolutely horrendous conditions in the Congo
- Cobalt is an essential component of lithium rechargeable batteries— increased demand with smartphones, but especially with EVs! Cobalt increases energy density and stability of batteries.
- A SLEW of negative health consequences in adults and children from heavy metal exposure, environmental contamination
- Who is responsible for abuses in the artisanal mining sector? Mining companies themselves (many Chinese), or tech companies?
