author:  Olivia Laing
commentary: "A collection of essays from critic Olivia Laing.. Some common themes she looks to address: how art is concerned with resistance and repair, not necessarily beauty; how art isn’t a magic tool for humanity (empathy still requires work!); looking beyond the artwork of paranoia to reformative, restorative works—those that are generative, innovative, creative. Also finding it fascinating to hear about the collaborations and interactions of the artists Laing profiles, how they influenced and inspired one another, introducing new themes and media and subject matters. I appreciate the additional significance of the narrative behind works of art, even when experiencing them by description rather than visually!"

## Intro
- Collection of essays and criticisms of artwork, mainly from last half century

## Artists’s Lives

- **Jean-Michel Basquiat** → New York artist, started off in graffiti, collab with Warhol
- [**Agnes Martin**](https://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/exhibition/agnes-martin/who-is-agnes-martin) → first works = grids, then painted, carefully-planned stripes of pastels; almost all abstract except very last drawing of a plant
- **[David Hockney](https://www.hockney.com/works/paintings/60s)** → one of Britain’s most famous artists, reinvented and explored many media and themes (swimming pools, LA, etc.)
    - Always learning to look, remembering that looking brings joy
- **Joseph Cornell** → boxes, collages (Surrealist?), movie-making
    - Collab with Yayoi Kusama
- **Robert Rauschenberg** → “combines,” the film Rocky
- **Georgia O’Keefe** → took one subject matter and painted it over and over to truly understand: flowers, wall with a door, cow skull
- **Derek Jarman** → Modern Nature, on gardening
    - It’s how we all go, in and out of the dark— but what a thing it is to have given off such a blaze (something like that, from *Song of Solomon*)

## Freeze Columns

- Protest form of stitched-mouths: silence = death, in response to AIDS and refugee crisis
- Art less about making objects than opening conversations
- Ali Smith’s writing = epitome of “and, and, and”

### Essays

- On Maggie Nelson’s *The Argonauts*— like much of her work, defies classification by genre; uses personal experiences to analyze culture, how obsessed we are to binaries
- What is the job or task of the artist? There is none: the duty of an artist is to be free.
