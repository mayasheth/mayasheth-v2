book_commentary: A collection of essays, fiction and non-fiction, by Andorran expats. Learned so much! Andorra is a tiny independent country “co-ruled” by the French and Spanish leaders (either princes or elected officials, don’t remember). Tons of outdoor activity options (winter sports, hiking) and a culture of “doing” without necessarily competing. Great tax situation which leads to lots of smuggling, especially of tobacco, but otherwise not too much crime. Many festivals throughout the year, from an interesting mix of Catholic and “pagan” traditions. Kinship with the Catalans (pro-self-governance and all) and therefore Força Barça! There’s a cool public bath sorta building (the Caldea Spa) with hot springs, cold baths, and other cool treatments, including a grapefruit pool.
