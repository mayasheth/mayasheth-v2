book_commentary:  2019 Man Booker winner. Just couldnâ€™t get into the audiobook, and always felt a little confused by all the characters. Maybe would have been better to actually read? Still, got a sense for some of the history (and classic British colonialism) and culture of Oman, which was interesting and new to me.
