- This was weird, I think in a good way? Initially had the vibe of annoying, melodramatic characters, but I ended up sympathizing with them as the book went on. The writing style was unique and lent itself well to audio— sometimes lyrical, lots of repetition, all the internal dialogue. I’m not sure if the sorta monotonic narrator added to the experience, but definitely affected it!
- Also had my favorite structure of following a bunch of random people whose lives eventually, inevitably, and unbeknownst to them, intersect.
- Another thing that stood out to me was the third-person omniscient POV— it was kind of striking to jump from one mind to another, to hear glimpses of what another person is/was/will be doing across the continent and maybe across time, and to be directly addressed (breaking the fourth wall? Is that what it’s called?). It made the day-to-day events and familiar insecurities of the characters feel a bit uncanny and a bit more engaging.
