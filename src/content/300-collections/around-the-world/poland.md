Also read:  *The Extinction of Irena Rey* ‚Äî Jennifer Croft
- Super-meta work of translation: written as a translated novel with ‚Äúnotes from the translator‚Äù of a story she was part of, but from another point of view‚Äî and that story is that of an author and her loyal group of translators representing many languages as they‚Äôre faced with a mysterious disappearance. And the actual author, Jennifer Croft, is herself an award-winning translator of Polish, Ukrainian, and Spanish works (her translation of Flights from Polish to English is my üáµüá± Poland book, actually!), although the book is written in English (obviously the language I‚Äôm reading in).
    - Translation is such a crazy process! Reminds me of *Babel* (an all-time favorite novel).
    - Well‚Ä¶ I fell asleep listening to the last 30% of this and had no desire to reread, whatever that means.
