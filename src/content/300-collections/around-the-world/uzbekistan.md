book_commentary: This was… not quite what I expected, something I’m not sure how to describe, and it’ll stay with me for a long time. Set in a Pennsylvania state park, the novel is both tied to its specific place & time and also spans continents & decades. The main character is cold and distant at first, her trauma  slowly appearing itself until a heartbreaking revelation (one of many) near the end— we’re left with so many questions, no resolutions, but that’s the point, I guess. There are no answers to claiming someone is good or bad, or knowing whether you acted right or wrong.
