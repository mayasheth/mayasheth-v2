book_commentary: Echos to the last book I listened to, A Passage North, were strong— a storyline driven by characters processing and reflecting after an unexpected death; a deep sense of culture, tradition and family in tension with sexuality and individual identity— although the structure and lens of this one were distinct. The cast of narrators (literary and literal) had more vivid personalities, with plot driven by interaction rather than introspection. Emezi also effectively built suspense around the cause of Vivek’s death, culminating in a burst of both expected and shocking revelations, in contrast to the gradual ebb of tension in A Passage North. Definitely listened to this one faster, but found value and enjoyment in both!
