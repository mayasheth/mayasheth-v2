book_commentary: "Learned a lot about Haitian culture and language (especially because I listened to this book, so actually heard what Creole sounds like!), as well as its complicated political history, full of not-so-well-intentioned interventions by the US of A. Premise: The intertwining stories of (1) an American SCUBA instructor living in Haiti, who is in love with (2) the intellectual, Brown-educated sister of his Haitian business partner, and (3) the American CIA agent and love interest of said business partner as they navigate, manipulate, and are manipulated by political unrest in the country. Loved the narration about SCUBA diving!"
