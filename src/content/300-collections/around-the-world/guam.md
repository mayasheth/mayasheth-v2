book_commentary: "Lovely quotes: “We made starcastles. We cartwheeled over constellations. We ran around and fell down on a blanket of stars. We took turns burying each other in a beautiful graveyard of celestial bodies.” and also, “Despite what we’ve been told, the world is not ours for the taking.”"
