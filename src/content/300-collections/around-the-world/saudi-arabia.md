book_commentary: "Also an Ohio book, if I want to get started on the states! Notable quote one: “Don’t forget, we fathers are fourth in respect after mothers. Your mother, then your mother, then your mother, *then* your father.” Notable two: “…*Inshallah* expresses the most certainty a person can have— because God is good, and with God’s will, you will be with the people you love.” Title reference: Jeddah is “the Bride of the Red Sea.”"
