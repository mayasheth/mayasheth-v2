book_commentary: Contemporary, the vibes of small coastal towns versus urban Istanbul. Introspective, the sadness of the end of summers and loss of childhood, thar liminal tension of second-generation immigrants who donâ€™t fully belong to their ancestral or current cultures. What is a daughter but a second chance?
