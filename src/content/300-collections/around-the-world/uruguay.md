book_commentary: "What did I learn? A glimpse of the sociopolitical unrest in the country during the 1970s, and the haunting effects of a dictatorship on its citizens. Read by the author, which is always compelling. The premise: a narrative told through the seamlessly-shifting perspectives of five young Uruguayan women, this story painted a picture of the dynamic interplay between class, race, and gender through the captivating thoughts and relationships between its deeply-characterized, flawed yet sympathetic cast. I was initially hesitant of having so many main characters to keep track of, but I quickly learned the voice and personality of eachâ€” and, surprisingly, cared about the fate of them all."
