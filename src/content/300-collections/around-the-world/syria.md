book_commentary:  'An idea that resonated— wanting to live but not exist as “bodied”... and some memorable quotes: “Sometimes to feel secure is it’s own medicine.” "...or maybe instinct is only a name, created to discount a wisdom to which  one has no access.” Overall, so rhythmic to listen to, almost like a longggg spoken word recitation. Pleasing, but kind of hard to follow the actual narrative.'
