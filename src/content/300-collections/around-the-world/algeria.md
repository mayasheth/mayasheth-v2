book_commentary: "In this epic, multigenerational novel set around Algeria and its diaspora (topics I know next to nothing about), Zeniter masters the style of omniscient narration to convey stories at the scale of history, community, family, and individual. I am intrigued and curious, as always, how the translation is affecting my reading. Also, the book is set in a fantastic serif font, which is always a plus. Another thing I appreciate: the steady, rolling pace of the novel, which reminds me of waves at sea, somehow. Never still, never pausing on any moment, but constantly moving forward while maintaining a sense of rising and falling action. The intergenerational component is also masterfully managed, which each character inheriting and complexifying the experiences of those who came before in the context of changing cultural and political landscapes."

More thoughts on *The Art of Losing*:
- Made me think: “She wondered whether she had developed a form of racism common to certain children of immigrants: she cannot imagine having a relationship with someone who comes from the sand region as her family.” And this, about the same girl inheriting her father’s “need to reinvent himself in order to feel he truly exists.”
- Re: the title (also referring to [this poem](https://poets.org/poem/one-art))— Zeniter grapples with  themes of of colonialism and oppression as she tells the history of the French-Algerian War and its resulting diaspora through the voices of people on many “sides” of the conflict. In doing so, she highlights what we are juststarting to face in the US: that while we converge on a single history told by the “winners,” we do not erase the truth of the many other realities that occurred.
