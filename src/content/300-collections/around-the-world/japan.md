book_commentary: "Itami gracefully builds the city and culture of Tokyo through the inner dialogue of her witty protagonist, employing clever metaphors and humorous remarks with ease.True fact: “Having a secret makes me feel safe,” because nobody knows the entirety of you, their opinions and judgements may not be true. In all: a heartbreaking love story."

	- I saw this as a montage of conversations, self- and relational-reflections with surprisingly relatable insights, stories within stories, and a bizarre amount of unnecessary sexual scenes. Not a book I’d choose to read again, but it was interesting, and I’ve wanted to read at least one of Murakami’s books, and this seemed to be the least weird.
