book_commentary: I know so little about migrants and the “crisis at the border,” so this book provided me with an impactful and jarring glimpse into one particular experience with the topics. The violence, comraderie, and conflicting factions highlighted the dynamic whirlwind of truth and lies that border-crossing can be.
