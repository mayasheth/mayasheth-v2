book_author: Han Kang, transl. from Korean by Deborah Smith & Emily Yae Won
book_commentary: A woman who cannot speak and a man who is going blind connect over Greek lessons. Kang’s detached, nameless treatment of characters only made their pain more stark. This was a short and intriguing listen, especially if you are interested in language or philosophy.

- *Crying in H Mart* — Michelle Zauner (2021/12)
	- Listened to the audiobook, narrated by the author— and her voice was very soothing! Zauner’s memoir conveys a gripping trio of fascinating authenticity about her Korean culture, brutal honesty of her childhood, and pondering processing of her relationship with her mother. Enjoyed and recommend.
