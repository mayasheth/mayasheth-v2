- *[On Time and Water](300-collections/media/magnason-on-time-and-water.md)* — Andri Snær Magnason, transl. by Lytton Smith
    - Magnason's musings on Iceland, climate change, and how they relate to... you guessed it, time and water. The narrative arc is driven by his interviews with his grandparents, documenting their stories, the world as it was for them as children, and the accelerating change that characterizes the world as it is now.
    - The parallels drawn between glaciers in Iceland and the Himalayas are powerful, as Magnason points out that the loss of the ice in the latter also deprives large populations of their source of fresh water. A future with less glaciers is not just sad for what our children will not see, but is also a geopolitical crisis.
