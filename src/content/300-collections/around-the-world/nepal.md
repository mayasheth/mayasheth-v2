book_commentary: Very long and very disturbing— wasn’t sure I’d make it through all 24 hours, but I surprised myself by starting to follow the characters a little more closely about half way through. Also, a lot of names and vocab I didn’t know the spelling of, which probably contributed to the slow start for me to get into it. Should have read the first chapter in text or something?
