book_commentary: "One of those novels that opens a window into an entire world of existence I’d never imagined: in this case, 1950s Morocco for a French woman and her “native” husband. Grappling directly with issues of race, class, and sex, Slimani nonetheless crafts an engaging and tangible world that I quickly became intrigued with."
