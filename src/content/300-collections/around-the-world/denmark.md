book_commentary: "Didn't really learn much, although it was novel to experience WWII from the perspective of a Danish child. The premise: A mid-century autobiographical coming-of-age story of a Danish creative writer, told with an almost cringe-worthy degree of honesty and emotional transparency. Honestly, I thought this was really boring, and I had no feelings but annoyance towards the narrator."
