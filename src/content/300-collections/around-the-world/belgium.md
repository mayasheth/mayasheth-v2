book_author: Vinciane Despret, transl. from Belgian by Brett Buchanan
book_commentary: Philosophical musings on what it means to be an animal (and thus, what it means to be human). I appreciated the diverse cast of philosophers that Despret drew from, and the way she made very intangible concepts come to life. She made me think deeply about the true connotation behind the words we use in research, particularly at the organismal scale.
