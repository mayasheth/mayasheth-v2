book_commentary: Follows a women living in Caracas during (current?) political turmoil and violence, through her escape to Spain. Learned a bit about the terrible and mercurial living situation in the country, including the economic mess, political persecution, and brutal suppression of the press. This was a frightening, haunting, and heartbreaking (I know, so many books have been, but itâ€™s the only word that seems true) glimpse into the reality of those living in Venezuela, and felt like a warning to what the consequences of far-right politics in our country may be.
