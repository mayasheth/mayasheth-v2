book_commentary: Spans basically from colonization + founding of the country to modern times, covers evil, noble, and weak guys, the suffering of the rest, conspiracy theories that are sort of true, the depressing immorality of our legal system & government, how large forces of industry manifest in individual lives… has a movie with Leonardo… couldn’t ask for much else!
