    > A hallucinatory dusk, washed with *colours to drive Monet to suicide*. At sunset the brightest sickle moon appeared in a gentle blue sky; minute by minute gathering in intensity it stayed until just before midnight.
    Night clear as a bell — *the blue passed through violet with strands of rose and old gold to become a deep indigo*. So etched were the moon and stars they seemed to have been cut out by a child to decorate a crib.
    The night sky here is a riot that outshines the brightest lights of Piccadilly; *the stars have the intensity of jewels*. So flat is the Ness that those stars that lie at the horizon touch your very feet and the moon tips the waves with silver.
